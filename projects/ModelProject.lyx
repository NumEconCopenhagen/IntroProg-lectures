Vision: 
\series default
Programming is more than writing code.
 The ultimate goal of the projects in this course is that you learn to formulate
 a programming problem of your own choice, and find your own way to solve
 it, and present the results.
 The bullets below are minimum requirements, but otherwise it is very much
 up to you, what you will like to do with your project.
 You can use pretty much any economic model that you have encountered during
 your studies.
 It is not a bad idea to do further work on a model you already have a good
 understanding of from a course, seminar or bachelor thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Note: 
\series default
If you departure point is a model presented in the lectures (e.g.
 AS-AD) or in the problem sets (e.g.
 the Solow model), the requirement for passing is higher than if you start
 from scratch.

Objectives:
\series default
 In your model analysis project, you should show that you can:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply numerical model analysis methods such as optimization and equation
 solving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Structure a code project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Document code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Present results in text form and in figures (put text in Markdown cells).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Content:
\series default
 In your model analysis project, you should at a minimum:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe an algorithm on how to solve your economic model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Solve the model using an optimization routine or an equation solver and
 simulate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Visualize how the solution changes across parametrizations.
 This is an important task (that also works as a debugging device).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Analyze one or more extensions of the baseline model.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

Structure: 
\series default
Your model analysis project should consist of:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A README.md with a short introduction to your project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A single self-contained notebook (.ipynb) presenting the analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fully documented Python files (.py)

 It is better to have a rather simple but well-tested model with nice vizualizat
ion and simulation compared to a larger model that does not succeed entirely.

Peer feedback:

After handing in, you will be asked to give peer feedback on the projects
 of two other groups.

General advice:
\series default
 In the beginning of the project, write your code in the way 
\begin_inset Formula $you$
\end_inset

 find most intuitive.
 Also if that is a slow implementation, which does not use optimized routines
 and such.
 You can then begin to optimize it when things seem to work the way you
 intend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Advice for choosing a model: 
\series default
You should preferably choose a model you are already familiar with, and
 you should definitely choose a model you find interesting.
 Think back to courses you have taken or are currently taking, particularly
 elective courses, a seminar or your bachelor thesis.
 Which models did you find the most exciting? Maybe there was a model which
 had an assumption you found unrealistic, which you could change and still
 be able to solve the model using numerical methods?
