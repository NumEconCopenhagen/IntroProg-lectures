Vision: 
\series default
Programming is more than writing code.
 The ultimate goal of the projects in this course is that you learn to formulate
 a programming problem of your own choice, and find your own way to solve
 it, and present the results.
 The bullets below are minimum requirements, but otherwise it is very much
 up to you, what you will like to do with your project.
 Remember to write your code in a manner that is apt for others to run and
 read when providing feedback.
 We hope to see some creative ideas!

Objectives:
\series default
 In your data analysis project, you should show that you can:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply data cleaning and data structuring methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply data analysis methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Structure a code project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Document code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Present results in text form and in figures.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

\series bold
Content:
\series default
 Find a subject you are interested in or perhaps have knowledge about already.
 For example the subject of your BA thesis (if you are that far), something
 related to your student job, or perhaps what you would like write about
 in your next thesis or seminar paper.
 It can also just be some data you find interesting.
 The important thing here is the quality of the code and the presentation
 of results, not whether you acquire new economic knowledge.
 In your data analysis project, you should at a minimum:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Import data from an online source of your own choosing (through download
 or an API).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Present the data visually (and perhaps interactively).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply some method(s) from descriptive economics (

).
 That is, make a report that tells a story in numbers and graphs about an
 economic phenomenon or trend.

\series bold
Structure: 
\series default
Your data analysis project should consist of:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A README.md with a short introduction to your project.
 It is written in Markdown like a Jupyter Notebook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A single self-contained notebook (.ipynb) presenting the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fully documented Python module files (.py).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data.
 If you do not access data through an API call in your Python scripts, then
 you must store it in a .csv file that is uploaded to your repository with
 the code files.
 Note that Github won't allow you to upload very large data sets (ie.
 multiple GBs).
\end_layout

\end_deeper

.
 Cleaning and joining a couple of data sets and then making some interactive
 figures might be just fine.
 Else you will be asked to extend it for the exam.
 Handing in something that is good but a bit short, is much better than
 handing in a bunch of random graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hand-in: 
\series default
On GitHub by uploading it to your repository in the dataproject folder:

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Peer feedback: 
\series default
After handing in, you will be asked to give peer feedback on the projects
 of two other groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Exam: 
\series default
Your data analysis project will be a part of your exam portfolio.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can incorporate feedback before handing in the final version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Note:}$
\end_inset

 You can find a few suggestions for APIs to use in the notebook about fetching
 data.
 You are very welcome to find data elsewhere!
